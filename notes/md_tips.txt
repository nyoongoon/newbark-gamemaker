- When x,y positions or speed are not integers, camera follow gets jittery

	Are you using non-integer hspeed for your character?

	I've noticed stuttering in the past when I've worked with hspeed and/or vspeed
	values that are not integers. The camera thus rounds itself to the nearest
	integer values, which causes that sort of jitter as the speed changes
	between two values.
