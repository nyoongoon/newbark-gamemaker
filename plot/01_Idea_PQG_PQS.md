# NewBark Engine Plot

**Pokemon Golden Past and Silver Future**

Mix of ideas from: Mechanics from core-series Pokemon games, Let's GO, Masters, Mysterious Dungeon, The Legend of Zelda Oracle Ages/Seasons

Main theme is Tradition vs Innovation.
Old and New.
Elder and Young.
Conservativity vs Progress.

Biologic vs Mechanical will be also a thing.

Villains (Team RR) want to control time travelling to bring dangerous technology from the future to the past and conquer the old world. For that they will capture Celebi to control its powers. Villains want to control the world with machines and create a lot of villain robot Pokemon.

In Gold, you will see the impact of this from the perspective of the people in that time,
while in silver you will see the effects of altering the timeline, with things suddenly changing but only a few people will realize they are living in a constantly rewritten present/future.


Dialga gets involved at some point, but it has minor protagonism.
Palkia and Giratina also have their own script and are catchable.
Arceus will be part of a postgame side-story, like in HG/SS.


MOs are replaced by unlockable Trainer/Pokemon sync-skills.
Jump-back fences is possible by the trainer thanks to a sync-skill (ride a Pokemon).

There are 10 gyms in every game, one per type. The goal of this game is to stop the villains from taking over the world. There is no Pokemon League, since it was destroyed.

Gyms are replaced by dungeons and badges are now elemental gems, filled with villains and corrupted Pokemon. You will need to resolve puzzles and defeat the boss in order to get the elemental gem, the parts of the mirror or the parts of the partiture for the arp. With all this you will be able to stop the villains. Think of it as a Zelda game: wind waker, oracles, etc.

There is more freedom to explore the world without a linear script, most gyms can be
done in the desired order, but they will unlock helpful skills that are not needed
to continue the story, but it would be harder without them.

Pokemon obedience and level caps achivement via badges is now changed by experience gain nerf/boost.
Up to certain levels Pokemon will start earning less experience unless you have the
proper badge. This will make the game harder to continue until you earn a badge: you can try
to finish the game with 1 badge and level 20 Pokemon, but it will be really really hard, god-level hard.

Kanto is not in the post game (for now), but there are extra areas to explore. Kanto and Johto got
 in war after the villains controlled time travelling, so travelling between regions is not allowed in the games: all Kanto access (the train, the Tohjo falls, the Plateau) is destroyed in the past, which it will affect future. Maybe with some extra story update access can be repaired...

## Version Differences

### Pokemon Quest Gold: Mirrors of the Past
- Main theme is tradition.
- Set 500 years before original Gold and Silver
- Celebi - Golden Mirror Form (Grass/Psychic with Steel moves stab)
- Magearna original form. Creation of Magearna happens: The first artificial Pokemon and the first with the artificial Robot type. It will be the reason the legendary time-traveller clock robot Pokemon is created 1000 years later.
- Legendary dogs in original forms
- Genesect original form exists as a fossil and can be revived
- Some fossil Pokemon will exist in the wild, in a protected area, they are still in danger
- Ho-Oh (with new Golden Glitter Form, like in the anime, alla Xerneas-active, activates once when HP is full)
- Medieval style villages, like in old-school RPGs
- It is more focused on traditional Pokemon games and old mechanics
- Mega Evolution exists as "Frenzy Change" and mega stones are no longer needed to be held, the Key Stone becomes the Rainbow Stone.
- Dinamax nests didn't exist yet, but there are tales about a Pokemon called Eternatus
- Z-moves exist as Sync moves but the Z-Crystals are not longer needed to be held. Sparkling Stone becomes the Sparkling Crystal.


### Pokemon Quest Silver: Chords of the Future
- Main theme is innovation
- Set 500 years after original Gold and Silver
- Celebi - Silver Arp Form (Grass/Psychic with Sound moves stab)
- New Psychic/Robot Legendary (resembles a cuckoo wall clock), Mewtwo-comparable stats. This is a mechanical Pokemon created by Team RR which is able to transport living beings, objects and even buildings back in time and forth. Face looks a bit ridiculous, like a typical Jessie and James robot.
- Mewtwo has quickly evolved into its final form all these years, giving birth to a new species with a evolutionary line (Mewmew and Mewtwo (modern form)). It becomes a very rare Pokemon that can be found in the wild in special areas. Mewtwo modern form looks like a smaller,cutier version of original mewtwo but with a more clean mono-color design like Mew. It is not longer considered a legendary but it has reduced stats that sum 600 (90,105,90,105,90,120), equiparable to Tyranitar and Metagross. It is very sensitive and has an ability that transforms special moves into physical or viceversa depending on its higher stat, so it's very versatile. Another ability is that gets stab for any move type it learns that has a power lower than 100. Keeps the Psychic type. Mewmew has Psychic type with 480 base stats (70, 85, 70, 85, 70, 100) and evolves at level 90 and can only evolve into the modern Mewtwo.
- Legendary dogs in reincarnated forms (with new abilities)
- Fossils can be found in caves
- Robot-like New Steel/Digital Legendary (digital clock form), Mewtwo-comparable stats. This form has been upgraded during all these 1000 years.
- Lugia (with new Silver Mist Form alla Daruma-mode, activates once when HP is halved or less)
- Futuristic cities and modern villages, like in Unova but even more futuristic
- It is more focused on modern Pokemon games and new mechanics
- Dinamax exists and there are some places with Gigantamax nests
- Mega Evolution is now told in the tales, but people think it is a myth
- Z-moves exist like in Quest Gold 


## Battle Phenomenas

Mega Evolution, Dinamax and Z-Move phenomenas are now simplified in and combined in order to be able to coexist together.

- Mega Evolution is known as Frenzy Mode: Changes Pokemon appearance and Boosts up to 100 base stat points, except HP
- Z-move phenomena is known as Sync Mode: Changes move visuals and Boosts moves and adds secondary effects
- Giga/Dinamax is known as Giant Mode: Changes Pokemon appearance and Doubles max HP (depending on Pokemon level)

- Giga/Dinamax moves disappear and are replaced by the Sync Mode
- Only one phenomena can be activated in every battle, they cannot be stacked
- Frenzy Mode and Giant Mode phenomenas lasts up to 3 turns only, afterwards they gets reverted
- Sync Mode only happens after 1 turn
- Modes can be activated when the Combo gauge is filled (like in masters).
- Successful moves fill the combo gauge progressively

## Ideas

- Versions differ a lot like Zelda Oracle of Ages and Seasons and like BW -> BW2
- Mobile-first
	- Notifications for new wild pokemon and battles
		if you are in a patch of grass or in a trainer facility
	- Android widget for catching Pokemon without opening the game
- With core games, Let's GO and Masters mechanics
	- Catching like Let's GO
	- Pokemon stats upgradeable like in Let's GO, but harder
	- Skills grid like in Masters
	- Battles like in Masters from 1 to up to 3 Pokemon on each side, but still with a team of up to 6.
	- Battle UI like in masters
- Flying type gets renamed to Wind, Steel renamed to Metal
- Sound-based moves become **new "Sound" type** (which affects Steel). Exploud family gets it. Jigglypuff family becomes Sound/Fairy, excepting Igglybuff that stays Normal/Fairy, Noivern: Flying/Sound, Jangmoo: Sound/Dragon. See https://aquietrefuge.com/best-sound-absorbing-materials/ and https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Sound-based_moves
	- Weakness: Flying, Ice, Grass
	- Resisted by: Flying, Ice, Fighting, Rock
	- Strong against: Steel, Robot
	- Resists: Steel, Robot
	- Inmune to: Traps? and Sleep status except if self-inflicted (rest)
	- Nature of their powers: Any kind of acoustics and sound waves, they can make things vibrate, shake and break, make other Pokemon confused or deconcentrated, disturbed, agitated, nervous, stressed. They also can make nice music.
- **New "Robot" type**. Porygon family and other artifical Pokemon gets it: Magearna: Robot/Fairy, Genesect: Bug/Robot, Claydol: Ground/Robot, Trubbish and Garbodor: Poison and Poison/Robot (built with electronic waste) ... See: https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Machine and https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Artificial_Pok%C3%A9mon
	- Weakness: Bug, Electric, Sound
	- Resisted by: Bug, Electric, Sound
	- Strong against: Ghost, Fairy
	- Resists: Psychic, Dark, Ghost, Fairy, Steel
	- Inmune to: Confusion status, mind moves (like Attract) and nightmares/curses (like move disable)
	- Robot moves have high precision and are mostly physical
	- Robots are usually very fast and have high defenses, average attacks and HP. They are in general average, bulky fast Pokemon.
	- Nature of their powers: Robot type is an artificial type created by humans. Robot Pokemon are created by humans directly or by accident. Some robot pokemon created other robots afterwards. They can control gravity, atmosphere, electronic devices, make light, emit lasers rays, take pictures and videos, control things remotely, pull heavy weights, do certain tasks very fast, think very fast solutions, bounce using springs and resorts, do high precision tasks, do calculations and maths, predict next moves, copy moves, produce mini-copies of itself, emulate others, repair stuff, travel into space surviving extreme conditions and void, ignore mind tricks, mechanically transform into something else, spread computer viruses, bug crashes, etc. The problem is that they are easily triggered by sounds/voices and they can be corto-circuited by bugs and electric outages or discharges. Robots are also easly scared by bugs, they believe they are a threat for their circutry and they run. They can also consum a lot of electricty though, and produce outages in entire cities. Robots are more commonly built using plastic, using metals but they can be also made of clay or minerals, organic materials with nanobots or via genetic manipulation and nanobot combination. A Pokemon can be also partially a robot with some mechanical limb. Fairies are curious about Robots and they fall in their trap. Robots make Ghosts nervous and scared. Robots don't fall into mind tricks or sinister attacks, that's why they resist all magic/mind-oriented types. They also resist steel moves, because robots deal well with steel.
- Pokemon types are complemented by new stat called type affinities, aka. type stabs.
	- They are like unlockable abilities, like in Masters.
- Pokemon types are complemented by new stat called type affinities, aka. type stabs.
	- They are like unlockable abilities, like in Masters.

- Move reminder, deleter and nick name is moved to the Pokemon menus, where you can edit that,
but you have to unlock trainer skills, like the IV judge in previous games.
- Happiness becomes a visual stat, as well as IVs and EVs, but that has to be unlocked by trainer skills too.
- IVs can now be assigned manually, as desired. Yield stat IVs now are just Yield IVs and vary from 1 to 5, like Masters orbs.
- Yield Orbs can also be used to unlock special abilities, moves, skills, boosts, trainer skills, ...
- Certain pokemon stats and types have been altered (Flygon family = Bug/Dragon with Ground stab, Silvally keeping Normal as primary type when holding a disc)
- Type effectivity chart has been rebalanced so Grass, Ice and Rock aren't weak to so many types. Every type
has now a max of 3 weaknesess.
- New legendary, which is like a missing Mewtwo-like creature of Gen 2
- New evolutions of old Pokemon, revisited evolution methods
